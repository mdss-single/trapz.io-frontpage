				<p>More! More! More territory! Take it all with new amazing game - Paper.io</p>
				<p>This game concept is linked to old Xonix, which appeared in 1984. Like in any other IO game there are you and enemies willing to outwit you. But you'll prevail of course :) Take their terriory and destroy your enemies, but be careful, your tail is your weak point.</p>
				<p>This game is very cool and has nice paper-like graphics and fluid animation. Enjoy!</p>
				<p>You can play paper.io online and offline both on a mobile device and a desktop computer. Get paper.io and join the world gaming community. Manage a small board and win territory from your rivals.</p>
				<p>The more space you win the higher ranking and scores you get. You have to act and think quickly. Develop your own strategy and action plan.</p>
				<p>Paperio has simple rules but is very addictive in its simplicity. The competitors are also on guard. Watch out for your tail.</p>
				<p>The game is very addictive and makes gamers from all over the world connect from home, from work, from campus or even the office!</p>
				<p>Join the game, figure out your strategy and become the ultimate winner. Have fun!</p>
